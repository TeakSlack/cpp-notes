## Who is this for?

Just me, really. It's meant to be a quick reference put into simple language so whenever I may need reminded of a feature of the language, large or small, I have a convenient reference. My notes at the moment primarily cover the simpler parts of the language. C++ is a convoluted language and a simple reference with code snippets that I understand is an invaluable resource.

## How is it organized?

While this is still very much an individual project, I strive to make it as organized and accessible to all as possible. With that being said, here is the organizational hierarchy (subject to change at any time, of course).

Each large topic has its own individual file, and larger topics (such as classes) will have their own folder as they just have so many topics to cover. These files will usually have the header of "\<topic\> in C++" with an intro sentence, much like this document. After this, there will be a "What is it?" section in which I will go over the basic premise of the topic. From here, sub-topics pertaining to that subject are covered, granted with an even smaller header. Each document should be kept relatively short in length. I seek to keep every document tidy and organized with fun bits of C++ knowledge added in.
